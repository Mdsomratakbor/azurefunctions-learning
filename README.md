### **Introduction to Azure Functions**  

#### **1️⃣ What is Azure Functions?**  
Azure Functions is a **serverless compute service** that allows you to run small, event-driven pieces of code (functions) without managing infrastructure. It automatically scales based on demand and runs in response to various triggers like HTTP requests, database changes, or scheduled events.  

#### **2️⃣ Serverless Computing Overview**  
Serverless computing is a cloud execution model where you write and deploy code without worrying about managing servers. The cloud provider handles **scalability, provisioning, and maintenance**. Key benefits:  
- **No infrastructure management** → Focus on writing code.  
- **Auto-scaling** → Resources adjust dynamically.  
- **Pay-as-you-go** → You’re billed only for execution time.  

#### **3️⃣ Benefits and Use Cases of Azure Functions**  
✅ **Benefits:**  
- **Cost-Effective** → Only pay when the function executes.  
- **Scalability** → Auto-scales based on workload.  
- **Event-Driven** → Responds to real-time events.  
- **Supports Multiple Languages** → C#, JavaScript, Python, etc.  

✅ **Use Cases:**  
- **API Backend** → Lightweight APIs with HTTP triggers.  
- **Data Processing** → Process logs, IoT data, or real-time analytics.  
- **Scheduled Tasks** → Automate jobs like backups or report generation.  
- **Integration** → Connect with Azure services like Blob Storage, Cosmos DB, and Event Grid.
